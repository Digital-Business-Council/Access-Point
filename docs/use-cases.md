# 6. Use Cases

This document describes the method of exchange for business documents between two Access Points. Access Points use business discovery services, implemented by DCL and DCP, to determine the receiver of an electronic business document. Access Points therefore act as clients to business discovery services. The DCP and DCL business discovery services are detailed in separate implementation guides. 

The use cases listed in this section are separated in two categories: 
 1. Use cases dealing with the actual operation of sending and receiving business documents; and 
 2. Use cases dealing with configuration and registration of information to enable the operational use cases.
