## 10.3 Signal Response Message 
A signal response message must be returned by the receiving Access Point. The RefToMessageId value is populated with the value of the MessageId element from the received user message.
Non repudiation of receipt is not required in the Profile. Non repudiation of receipt is a business concern and support in this messaging protocol has been removed.
